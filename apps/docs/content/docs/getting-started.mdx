## Automatic Installation

Create a new app with `qrdx`, it requires Node.js 18+.

Initialize a config for CLI:

```package-install
qrdx@latest
```

You can change the output paths of components in the config.


#### How the magic works?

The CLI fetches the latest version of component from the GitHub repository of qrdx.
When you install a component, it is guaranteed to be up-to-date.

Make sure to use the latest version of qrdx.
