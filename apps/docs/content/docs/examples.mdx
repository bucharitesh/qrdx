## Installation

Initialize a config for CLI:

```package-install
qrdx@latest
```

You can change the output paths of components in the config.


#### How the magic works?

The library fetches the latest version of component from the GitHub repository of qrdx.
When you use the library, it is guaranteed to be up-to-date.

Make sure to use the latest version of qrdx.
